  /*
    Write a function called myFunc. 
    Inside the function, we'll create a variable and another function. 
    Call the variable myStr and set it to the string 'super secret string'. 
    Call the function getSecretString and have it return the myStr variable. 
    myFunc should return getSecretString

  ////////////PROBLEM 2////////////

  /*
    Write a function called lightSwitch. It will return an inner function.
    Create a variable inside lightSwitch called isTheLightOn and set its initial value to the boolean false. 
    Write a function called flipTheSwitch inside lightSwitch. 
    The function should invert the value of isTheLightOn and return a string. 
    If the light is on (true), the string should be 'The light is on'
    And if the light is off (false), the string should be 'The light is off'. 
    The lightSwitch function should return flipTheSwitch.

  //Create a variable called kitchenSwitch whose value is the invocation of lightSwitch.
  
  //CODE HERE

  
  //Invoke kitchenSwitch.

  /*
    Use the module pattern to create a plant height tracker, name your function 'plantTracker'
    Set up two variables inside plantTracker, 'plant' which should be set to 'fern' and 'height' which should be set to 12
    Return 3 functions using the module pattern
      - 'readInfo' should return a string of 'This is a PLANT plant that is HEIGHT inches tall.', where PLANT is the value of the plant variable and HEIGHT is the value of the height variable.
      - 'waterPlant' should add 1 to the height and return the new height
      - 'prunePlant' should subtract 1 from the height and return the new height
